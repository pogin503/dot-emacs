Overview
********

Riece is a user interface for IRC (Internet Relay Chat).  You should
spell it with the first letter capitalized and pronounce it as /ri:s/.

The features of Riece are as follows:

   * Several IRC servers may be used at the same time.

   * Many features built upon the extension mechanism called add-on.
     Currently 30 such add-ons are available.

   * Installation is easy.  Riece doesn't depend on other packages.

   * Setup is easy.  Automatically save/restore the configuration.

   * Step-by-step instructions are included.

   * Mostly compliant with the latest IRC client protocol (RFC 2812).

Getting started
***************

To start Riece, follow the instruction below:

  1. `M-x load-library riece'

  2. `M-x riece'

In case that `Cannot open load file: riece' is signalled in (1), you
should probably have an installation problem.  If you installed Riece
from source tarball, please read README again.  If you are trying to
use a package distribution, check out the documentation.

Once Riece started successfully, you will be asked the name of the IRC
server to connect.  IRC servers publicly available are taken from the
Web pages of IRC networks:

   * http://www.ircnet.jp
   * http://freenode.net

You may see the following message:

     Nickname "ueno" already in use.  Choose a new one:

In IRC, users are identified by *nicknames*.  If the nickname you
selected has already used by another person, you must select the new
one.

In IRC, users join the *channels* to start multi user conversation.
To join a channel, type `C-c j'.  On IRCnet, there is a channel named
`#Riece' where you can do some tests to get experienced with Riece.

After you joined a channel, the layout of windows are changed to the
following:

     +-----+-----------------+
     |     |                 |
     |     |                 |
     | (1) |       (2)       |
     |     |                 |
     |     |                 |
     +-----+-----------------+
     |     |       (4)       |
     |     +-----------------+
     | (3) |                 |
     |     |       (5)       |
     |     |                 |
     +-----+-----------------+

You can send messages by entering messages in (4).  Messages from
other persons are shown in (2).

Basic usage
***********

To start Riece, you just type `M-x riece'.  Then you will prompted for
the name of an IRC server.  A typical IRC network may consist of
several IRC servers and you will need to pick up appropriate one.
Most of IRC networks provide a list of available servers on their Web
pages:

   * http://irc.kyoto-u.ac.jp
   * http://freenode.net

If your nickname is taken, you will be asked to use different one.
The initial nickname can be set via the variable `riece-nickname'.  By
default, your nickname is generated from your login name.

After successfully connecting to an IRC server, you can join a channel
and talk with people there.  To join a channel, type `C-c j'.  By the
way there is a channel called `#Riece' on IRCnet, so feel free to use
it for testing.

Now you enter a message and it will be seen by everyone else on the
channel.  Messages from other people will appear on the top-left
window.

Windows
=======

By default, Riece uses 5 windows to inform user of his status:

     +-----+-----------------+
     |     |                 |
     |     |                 |
     | (1) |       (2)       |
     |     |                 |
     |     |                 |
     +-----+-----------------+
     |     |       (4)       |
     |     +-----------------+
     | (3) |                 |
     |     |       (5)       |
     |     |                 |
     +-----+-----------------+

Each window is used for different purpose:

  1. "user list window" (`*Users XXX*').  Users on the current channel
     are listed in this window.

  2. "channel window" (`*Channel XXX*').  This window keeps dialogues
     on the current channel.

  3. "channel list window" (`*Channels*').  All channels you are
     joined are listed in this window.

  4. "command window" (`*Commands*').  This window is used for either
     sending messages or issueing commands.

  5. "others buffer" (`*Others*').  This window displays dialogues on
     channels except the current channel.

Indicators
==========

Indicators are characters which indicate your status.  Usually they
are put on the left side of the modeline like:

     Riece: -- ueno #Riece [n]

In this case, `---' are indicators.  From left to right their meanings
are:

  1. You are not "away". (If you marked yourself as "away", it would be
     `A')

  2. You are not an IRC operator. (If you entered operator mode, it would be
     `O')

  3. The channel window is not locked.  (If it was locked, it would be
     `F'.  If it was locked until next send, it would be `f')

Connecting to multiple servers
==============================

One of the most important features of Riece is that users can use
several IRC servers at the same time.

The procedure to use multiple servers consists (1) connecting to the
foreign server and (2) joinning a channel:

  1. Type `C-c O' (`riece-command-open-server'), and then you will be
     asked the server name.

  2. Type `C-c j' (`riece-command-join') to join a channel.  Here the
     server name follows the channel name.  To input a space
     character, use `C-q'.  For example, if you want to join the
     channel `#Riece' on the server `irc6', type `C-c j #Riece C-q SPC
     irc6'.

If you want to send IRC command without joinning a channel, `C-c M'
(`riece-command-universal-server-name-argument') may be useful.

Commands used for connection management are listed below:

`C-c O'
     Connect to the foreign server. (`riece-command-open-server')
`C-c C'
     Close the connection to the
     server. (`riece-command-close-server')
`C-c M'
     Issue a command on the specified
     server. (`riece-command-universal-server-name-argument')
